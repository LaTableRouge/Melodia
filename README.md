Melodia is a Slint rewrite of a former Tauri + SolidJS application. Dropping the embedded WebKitGTK browser engine took the real-world footprint from a combined **~900 MB** to 87 MiB idle on Linux (PSS) and 105 MiB on Windows (commit); the [full numbers](#footprint) are below.

## Screenshots

Six theme families, light and dark variants, configurable accents, and Material You dynamic color; the shots below are a handful of them, all on the default aurora backdrop. See [Themes](#themes) below for the full list.

### Mini-player

Shrink the window past a threshold and the full UI collapses into a compact mini-player. It grows with the window rather than switching between layouts: a one-line strip, then a card with the controls sliding under the title beside larger artwork and the window buttons opening above, then a column with Up Next or lyrics below. Close Melodia from it and it opens as the mini-player next time, with its restore button still returning to the full-size window you had.

## Features

### Library
- A first-run card that opens on your library, adding your Music folder in one click or any other folder you pick, then sets language, theme and accent, and names every feature that reaches the network so you can switch it on or leave it off. Three panels, closeable in a click, and reachable again from Settings ▸ About
- Parallel folder scanning, live folder watching, and incremental re-scans
- Content hashing (BLAKE3), so a moved or renamed file keeps its play counts, favorites, and place in the queue
- Full-text search (SQLite FTS5) over tracks, albums, artists, and genres, and over the people credited on a track, so a composer or a producer reaches their work: accent-insensitive, relevance-ranked, with a top-result card and recent history. The filter box on every list searches the same fields
- **My Library** gathers everything into one page with five tabs (Songs, Albums, Artists, Genres, Playlists); opening an entity grows the tab band into its banner rather than navigating away
- Favorites and Recently Played, each a hero banner over sortable lists and browsable card grids
- Browse by folder, as a detailed list or a grid of cards
- Star ratings, play and skip counts, natural sort, resizable and toggleable columns
- Multi-selection on every library list and card grid: tick one to start, then a click anywhere on a row or card adds the next and shift-click takes a range. Right-click acts on the whole set, from queueing it to editing its tags; `Esc` clears it
- Copy from any right-click menu: a song's title, artist, album, "Artist - Title" or file path, an album's name and artist, or a station's name, stream URL or website. A selection copies one line per item, in the order it was picked, and the queue's in queue order
- Tag editing for one track or many at once, cover art included, written straight back to the files. A track's artists, its genres and the ten studio credits (composer, lyricist, conductor, performer, producer and the rest) are each an editable list rather than one text box, beside the rest of what a file can carry: work and movement, key, mood, ISRC, and the release's own label, catalog number, barcode and medium
- Manual and smart playlists, the latter rule-based and resolved live; `.m3u8` import and export, several at once as a single `.zip` that imports back without extracting, drag-and-drop import and reordering
- A database backup before every schema migration, three kept

### Playback
- Gapless, including the AAC encoder delay and padding read back from `iTunSMPB` or the MP4 edit list, and the trailing padding a Matroska file states
- Crossfade (1–12 s) across two decks with a clip-safe ramp, optionally skipped between same-album tracks, and under exclusive output too wherever the next track needs no change of device format
- 10-band equalizer (31 Hz – 16 kHz) with preamp, presets, and a soft-knee limiter
- ReplayGain in track or album mode, with preamp and peak-based clip prevention
- Queue with shuffle and repeat; playing from any list queues that list behind your pick
- Hold Previous or Next to scan through a track in short audible jumps that grow the longer you hold, and hold Play/Pause to stop, which takes the track back to its start
- Full-screen Now Playing with an up-next list and a spectrum, mirrored, or waveform visualizer tinted to the album's own colors
- Playback speed 0.25×–2.0×, a playback-linked sleep timer, resume on startup, media keys
- Band-limited sample-rate conversion wherever a file's rate isn't the output's or the speed isn't 1×, carried across gapless track changes, and skipped entirely where the rates already match
- Responsive mini-player: shrink the window and the UI collapses to a strip, a card or a column with Up Next or lyrics, one layout that rearranges as you resize instead of jumping between them

### Bit-perfect output
- **Exclusive output** on Linux and Windows, off until you choose it under Settings ▸ Playback ▸ Output. Melodia takes the audio device for itself and hands it the decoder's samples at each file's own sample rate and bit depth, with no system mixer in between: an ALSA `hw:` device on Linux, asked of the sound server so it is handed back cleanly, and WASAPI exclusive mode on Windows
- A **Signal Path** panel follows the playing track from the file to the device, grades every stage that can change it (the decoded format, EQ and ReplayGain, speed, volume, a crossfade, the sample rate, the channel layout and the output itself), and sums it up as Bit-perfect, Enhanced (only effects you chose), Converted, Lossy (a compressed file, whatever else the path does), or Fallback (a refused claim, which outranks the rest). **Make Bit-Perfect** switches off whatever you chose that changes the sound, and from shared output asks to switch to exclusive
- A quality chip in the player bar carries that verdict and the device's rate, and opens the panel in one click. It shows only under exclusive output, and moves into the overflow menu if you'd rather
- **Output Device** (**Exclusive Device** on Linux) picks the sound card exclusive output claims. On Windows it routes shared output too, and its System Default entry follows whichever device Windows makes the default. A chosen device you unplug hands playback to the default and is taken back as soon as it returns. On Linux the sound server routes shared output, and remembers where you moved it in its own mixer
- A device that refuses the claim never costs you the music: playback carries on shared (on Windows, through that same device), a notification names the device, and the panel says why
- **Unsupported Sample Rates** can keep the claim for a file at a rate the device lacks, resampling it to one the device has rather than handing it to the system mixer, and an album mixing such rates stays gapless wherever the device's own rate doesn't change
- Dither wherever samples Melodia changed are narrowed to 16 or 24 bits, so a quiet fade ends in a soft hiss rather than distortion, while untouched samples still pass bit-exact
- **Hardware Volume** turns the device's own volume control instead of scaling the samples, so the slider keeps the sound bit-perfect, and the system's own volume keys move Melodia's slider with it
- **Give the Device Back When Paused** hands the device to other apps after five minutes paused; pressing play takes it again and carries on where it stopped
- A buffer period to choose, a short silence for the DACs that mute while they switch sample rates, and on Windows a polling mode for USB devices that stutter under exclusive output
- In shared mode on Linux, **Match the File's Sample Rate** reopens the device at each track's own rate wherever the sound server allows it
- Unplugging the device or restarting the sound server picks playback up on the new output at the same position

### Lyrics
- A panel in the Now Playing column in place of Up Next, turned on from the switch in that view's header or under Settings ▸ Services ▸ Lyrics. A timed sheet follows the song line by line, and clicking a line seeks to it
- **Off by default, and off means off**: while lyrics are switched off, Now Playing shows Up Next and nothing looks a sheet up or keeps one in memory
- Read from a `.lrc` beside the track or from the file's own lyrics tag, so a library that already carries them needs no online lookup
- **Online lookup is off until you switch it on**, from the lyrics menu or under Settings ▸ Services ▸ Lyrics. Nothing contacts **lrclib.net** until you do, and what it answers is cached under your data folder rather than written into your files
- Romanization printed under a line written in a script you don't read. Korean and Japanese each get an engine matched to them; around a hundred scripts are covered in all, Chinese, Cyrillic and Arabic among them. On by default, and it draws nothing for a sheet already in Latin letters
- A bilingual sheet's translation is drawn under the words it glosses
- **Look up again** when a sheet matched the wrong recording, **Save to file** to write the one on screen into the track's own tag, and **Edit lyrics…** when it is nearly right and a stamp needs typing. The Edit Tags dialog offers the same sheet above its Lyrics field

### Internet Radio
- **Off until you switch it on**, under Settings ▸ Services ▸ Radio. Nothing contacts the directory until you do
- A worldwide directory (**radio-browser.info**, no account and no API key) narrowed by country, language, genre, codec, or bitrate
- Your own stream URLs, checked at the dialog rather than at the first click; `.pls`, `.m3u`, and `.asx` resolve to the audio behind them
- Live titles reach the player bar, Now Playing, your desktop's media controls, and Discord, with buffering and reconnection handled underneath
- Favorites, Recently Played, station pages, cached logos, and playlist-file import and export
- Station cards select like any other card on all three tabs, with a right-click menu to play one, star or copy one or many, and to edit or remove the stations you keep
- The titles a station has announced this session, listed under it and copyable from a right-click, artist and title apart where the line splits
- Segmented (HLS) stations play like any other

### Themes
Six families, each with light and dark variants and configurable accents: **Catppuccin** (Latte, Frappé, Macchiato, Mocha), **Material 3**, **GNOME Adwaita**, **KDE Breeze**, **Windows Fluent**, and **macOS**. System dark/light is followed automatically, KDE color schemes are read from `kdeglobals`, and Material You derives a palette from the current artwork in seven color styles. Headers paint an aurora of the album's own colors by default, or a blurred cover instead. The titlebar is custom and transparent, with native decorations available, and KDE opens on its native one. A first launch picks the desktop's own theme too: Windows Fluent, KDE Breeze and GNOME Adwaita follow the system's light or dark mode, and any other desktop starts on Catppuccin Mocha.

### Formats and languages
MP3, FLAC, M4A/M4B (AAC and ALAC), raw AAC (`.aac`), Ogg Vorbis (`.ogg`, `.oga`), Opus (`.opus`, up to 7.1), WAV (PCM and ADPCM), AIFF/AIFF-C, Matroska (`.mka`), and CAF. Matroska and CAF carry no tags Melodia can read, so those tracks list under their filename, as does anything whose tags are too damaged to parse.

Sixteen locales (English, German, French, Spanish, Turkish, Greek, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Indonesian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Vietnamese), switchable at runtime with no restart.

### System integration
- Scrobbling to **Last.fm** and **ListenBrainz**, each independently, with loved-track sync that catches your existing favorites up on connect, and a durable offline queue. A ListenBrainz love needs the track's MusicBrainz recording ID in its tags
- **Discord Rich Presence** (off by default): title, artist, album, and optionally a cover looked up on Deezer, sent to your running Discord client. Nothing leaves the machine while it is off
- OS media controls (MPRIS2 on Linux, SMTC on Windows) and media keys
- A system-tray icon with playback controls, on by default, and an optional close-to-tray; both under Settings ▸ Interface
- A daily update check, named on first run and switchable under Settings ▸ Updates. It asks GitHub for a signed manifest and nothing else; package-managed installs skip it entirely
- Set Melodia as your default player and double-click a track; it runs as a single instance, so files open in the window you already have
- Always-on-top on Windows, on any X11 desktop, and on Wayland under KDE, or GNOME with the Window Calls extension
- On Linux, a self-deploying desktop entry and AppStream metadata for KDE Discover and GNOME Software
- Window, queue, and navigation state persisted across sessions

## Footprint

Release builds against the same 512-track library on one dual-boot PC, a Ryzen 7 9800X3D (8 cores, 16 threads) with an RTX 3080 and the window on a 144 Hz display. On both platforms Melodia opened on the same playlist, its detail view showing the hero banner, and the visualizer ran in the Mirrored style. After 30 s to settle, each scenario is sampled every second for 60 s: memory is the median sample, CPU and GPU the total over that minute. Each platform's table uses what its own kernel accounts for, so the columns differ between the two.

### Linux (Fedora)

Measured with [`scripts/measure-linux-footprint.sh`](scripts/measure-linux-footprint.sh) on KDE Plasma under Wayland.

Linux keeps no commit charge per process, so **Anonymous** is the figure to compare: the memory Melodia allocated itself, in RAM or in swap, which nothing another process does can move. It is also the number that stays flat, since grids and track lists are virtualized and the cover caches are capped against the display, so a larger library barely moves it. **PSS** is KDE System Monitor's Memory column. It adds a share of the file-backed pages, mostly the binary and the shared graphics stack rather than anything Melodia allocated, and that share shrinks whenever another program maps the same libraries. **USS** is the part no other process maps, what closing Melodia gives back, and System Monitor's Private column. **RSS** counts every shared page in full. **GPU memory** is the video memory the NVIDIA driver charges to Melodia, where FemtoVG keeps its textures and framebuffers, counted apart from the rest. **CPU (1 core)** counts one full core as 100%, and **CPU (all cores)** spreads that across all 16 threads, as System Monitor's CPU column does. **GPU** is the utilization the NVIDIA driver reports for Melodia, in whole percents each second.

### Windows

Measured with [`scripts/measure-windows-footprint.ps1`](scripts/measure-windows-footprint.ps1).

#### Custom titlebar

| Playing, visualizer live | 115 MiB | 67 MiB | 126 MiB | 27 MiB | 19 MiB | 9.06% | 0.57% | 2.17% |

Windows keeps no PSS, so **Commit** is the figure to compare: the private memory Windows has set aside for Melodia, in RAM or paged out, which doesn't fall when Windows trims the process. **Private WS** is Task Manager's Memory column, the private memory in RAM at that moment. **Working set** adds the pages Melodia shares with other processes, mostly system DLLs. **GPU dedicated** and **GPU shared** are the video memory Task Manager lists per process, where FemtoVG keeps its textures and framebuffers, counted apart from commit. **CPU (1 core)** counts one full core as 100%, and **CPU (all cores)** spreads that across all 16 threads, as Task Manager's Details tab does. **GPU** is the busiest GPU engine, Task Manager's per-process figure.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

OS media keys (play/pause, next, previous, stop) are also handled. Stop takes the track back to its start, as holding the Play/Pause button does.

## Installation

Linux (X11 and Wayland) and Windows, on both `x86_64` and `aarch64`. Take the latest build from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/KenanSalar/Melodia/releases).

| Format | Install |
|--------|---------|
| `.rpm` (Fedora/RHEL) | `sudo dnf install ./melodia-*.rpm` |
| `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) | `sudo apt install ./melodia-*.deb` |
| AppImage | `chmod +x melodia-*.AppImage && ./melodia-*.AppImage` |
| Tarball | Extract, then `./install-linux.sh`, which installs into `~/.local/share/Melodia` with no `sudo`, so the in-app updater needs no polkit prompt |
| Windows | Run the installer, or use the portable binary |

Melodia updates itself in place, minisign-signed. Release artifacts also carry
build-provenance attestations, verifiable with:

```bash
gh attestation verify <file> --repo KenanSalar/Melodia
```

## Building from Source

[Rust](https://rustup.rs/) **1.97.0**, edition 2024, pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` and installed by
rustup on its own. Linux additionally needs the development packages for Slint's FemtoVG renderer
(no WebKitGTK); macOS and Windows need nothing extra.

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev libasound2-dev \
                 libxkbcommon-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers libwayland-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install fontconfig-devel freetype-devel alsa-lib-devel \
                 libxkbcommon-devel vulkan-loader wayland-devel
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KenanSalar/Melodia.git
cd Melodia

cargo run -p melodia                                     # debug build, runs the app
cargo build --release -p melodia                         # release → target/release/Melodia
cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings    # lint
cargo test --workspace                                   # tests
```

With only Docker on the host, `scripts/dev-container.sh` runs any of the commands above but `cargo
run` inside the Linux toolchain CI uses, translation and icon-font tooling included; with no
arguments it opens a shell. The container is headless, so the app itself still runs natively. Give
Docker 12 GB or more for `cargo test`, whose largest crate peaks near 9 GB to compile.

A source build keeps its own library under `Melodia-dev`, beside an installed copy's folder rather
than inside it, so a schema migration still on a branch can't leave an installed Melodia unable to
open its database, and the two can run at once. `MELODIA_DATA_DIR` points either build at a
directory of your choosing.

`winit/` is a checked-in copy of winit 0.30.13 plus an unmerged Wayland file drag-and-drop fix
([winit#1881]), wired by `Cargo.toml`'s `[patch.crates-io]`. A fresh clone builds with no setup;
dropping the patch costs only that drag-and-drop.

Last.fm scrobbling needs an [API application](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)'s key and
shared secret, which identify the app rather than any account. They are read at compile time from
`LASTFM_API_KEY` / `LASTFM_SHARED_SECRET`, so nothing secret lives in the repo; for local builds,
copy `.env.example` to `.env` and `build.rs` bakes them in. A build without them is fully
functional, ListenBrainz included, and the Last.fm Connect button reports "not configured in this
build". A fork wanting its own Discord presence sets `MELODIA_DISCORD_APP_ID`.

[winit#1881]: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1881

## Architecture

The Slint UI runs on the main thread and a single multi-threaded Tokio runtime handles the database,
scanner, watcher, player control, and HTTP. There is no WebView and no IPC boundary: UI callbacks
spawn async work, state flows back over `watch` and `mpsc` channels consumed by UI-thread tasks, and
cpal's device callback, or an exclusive claim's own writer thread, pulls the mixer directly, so
decoding, the DSP chain, and the mix stay off the runtime entirely.

Fourteen crates, layered so the compiler enforces the direction rather than a convention: the UI
names no database or socket, the decoders name no mixer, the tag writer names no state machine.
Slint 1.16 on FemtoVG, Tokio, Symphonia and cpal (with ALSA and WASAPI directly for exclusive output),
SQLite via SQLx with WAL and FTS5, Lofty for tags, Rayon, BLAKE3, and minisign for the updater.

[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) is the architecture reference; [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) records why each
piece was chosen over the alternatives.

## Data and Logs

Everything lives under the OS application-data directory, `~/.local/share/Melodia` on Linux and
`%APPDATA%\Melodia` on Windows:

| File / folder | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `melodia.db` | The music library (SQLite, WAL + FTS5) |
| `settings.json`, `views.json`, `queue.json` | Preferences, per-view UI state, and the queue with the station tuned over it |
| `scrobble_*.json` | Last.fm session key and ListenBrainz token (`0600` on Unix), plus the offline queue |
| `artwork/`, `artists/`, `radio-logos/` | Cached album, artist, and station images. A deleted cover is put back from your music files on the next scan |
| `lyrics/` | Sheets the online lookup found, and a marker for the tracks it found none for |
| `backups/` | Database copies taken before each schema migration |
| `logs/` | Rolling logs and crash reports |

`MELODIA_DATA_DIR` moves the whole folder somewhere else.

Melodia writes a log on every run, with no environment variable and no terminal needed, and leaves a
crash report beside it if it ever panics. The current log is `melodia_rCURRENT.log`; it rotates at
2 MiB and keeps the 7 most recent, so `logs/` stays under about 16 MiB.

**Settings → About → Diagnostics** opens that folder, saves a single `melodia-diagnostics-*.txt` to
attach to a bug report, and toggles verbose logging. The report carries your version, OS, desktop
session and install method, your library's size, a short fixed list of settings, recent crash
reports, and the tail of the logs. Home directory paths are shortened to `~`, and **no credentials,
tokens or session keys are ever included**; those live in a separate file the report doesn't read.

If Melodia won't start at all, `melodia --logs` prints the log directory and exits. That covers Linux
and macOS: a Windows build runs with no console attached, so use `%APPDATA%\Melodia\logs\` directly.
For finer control than the verbose switch, `RUST_LOG=debug melodia` overrides the filter for both the
log file and the terminal.

## Contributing and Support

Contributions are welcome. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the setup, the checks to run

Melodia is free, open source, and built in my spare time, with nothing gated behind payment. If it's
useful to you, you can support me at [ko-fi.com/kenansalar](https://ko-fi.com/kenansalar), the same
link the app carries at **Settings → About**.

## License

Copyright (C) 2026 Kenan Salar. Melodia is free software under the
[GNU Affero General Public License](LICENSE), version 3 or, at your option, any later version, and is
distributed without any warranty.

The AGPL covers Melodia itself. Two fonts, a patched winit fork and several crates on copyleft terms
(the UI toolkit, the audio decoders and the Japanese romanization engine) are compiled into the
binary under their own terms; every one of those licenses ships in [`licenses/`](licenses/), which
every package carries alongside this file.

## Acknowledgments

Built on the work of the [Slint](https://slint.dev/),
[cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal),
[Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia), and
[SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) projects, the
[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) palette, and
[Material Foundation](https://m3.material.io/)'s color utilities, along with the many other crates
listed in `Cargo.toml`. The station directory is [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info)
(CC0 data, no account), and the lyrics directory is [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) (also no account).
Romanization is [uroman-rs](https://github.com/stellanomia/uroman-rs) for most scripts and
[kakasi](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/kakasi) for Japanese.

Melodia's interface is set in [Vazirmatn](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazirmatn) (SIL Open Font
License 1.1), with its Greek, Russian, Ukrainian and Vietnamese letters taken from
[Roboto](https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto-3-classic) (Apache License 2.0), and draws its icons
from [Material Symbols Rounded](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) (Apache License
2.0). All three are modified, as is the vendored [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) fork
(Apache License 2.0) that gives Wayland its drag-and-drop events. What changed in each ships in
[`licenses/`](licenses/).
