// Source pins for shared components with no Rust module of their own — the
// three faked-placeholder inputs and the tooltip pill, the two pinned bands (the one
// both mosaic pages wear and My Library's own), the blur stack under both of them, the
// header row all three of those plus the Settings page share, and `IconButton`, whose
// glyph sits outside the disc and places itself — nested it costs a layer per frame of a
// band morph, centred by a layout it folds an animated press into every host's layout
// cache. Each reads the one component it is about, by name.
// `startup_motion_tests` pins two components across a second seam: what the shell and the
// view mounted inside it do on the frame the window opens, and on the miniplayer swap's
// crossfade. `titlebar_tests` reaches a third
// tree — it holds the brand mark's theme brush to the asset it is painted over, the only
// thing here a dark-palette reviewer cannot see going wrong, and `caption_tests` reaches it
// for the decoration buttons, whose fill answers to the OS decoration beside the window and
// to a backdrop that is off by default. `frameless_tests` holds the
// shell's frame bindings and the miniplayer's exit edge to one another, a pairing only a Win32
// or macOS frame shows breaking.
//
// What used to sit among them and no longer does is the set that walked the *tree* rather
// than reading a component: those are `crates/melodia/tests/`, on the rule that a check
// enumerating a corpus does not belong in a crate the corpus contains.
