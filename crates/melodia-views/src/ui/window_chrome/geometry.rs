//! Persisted window geometry restore + snapshot.
//!
//! **Restore** runs in `main.rs` between `AppWindow::new()` and `app.run()`. Size and
//! position go through `slint::Window::set_size` / `set_position` rather than the
//! `WindowAttributes` hook, because `set_size` flips `has_explicit_size` in the winit
//! backend and that flag, re-read at first show, is what stops Slint snapping the window
//! to its content-preferred size; `with_inner_size` does not set it. Both calls land
//! before the winit window exists, so they become the ordinary WM request and a KDE window
//! rule still wins. **Maximized** has no `slint::Window` API at all, so `main.rs`'s
//! window-attributes hook applies `with_maximized(true)` during `AppWindow::new()` — no
//! un-maximize→maximize flash.
//!
//! **Save** can't read winit: `shutdown::save_state_on_exit` runs after `app.run()`
//! returns, by which point the window is destroyed and `with_winit_window` answers `None`.
//! [`super::winit_filter`]'s `Resized` / `Moved` handlers call [`record`] to keep an
//! in-memory mirror while the window is alive, and [`snapshot_into`] reads it at exit.
//!
//! Wayland forbids a client setting its own position, so `set_position` is a silent no-op
//! there. Size still works.
//!
//! **The miniplayer is a window size, so the full player's geometry has to be held across it.**
//! Entering it [`hold_full_player`]s the last placement that sat still, and its restore button
//! hands that back through [`restore_full_player`]. A close while it is up persists the miniplayer
//! as the window and the hold beside it, so the next launch reopens the miniplayer and its restore
//! button still knows the player the user shrank away from.
//!
//! **The frame the miniplayer drops is measured as the step it costs the client, not asked of the
//! window.** [`frame_allowance`] carries the argument; the exit edge and the restore both want that
//! step and nothing else, so there is one number rather than a query per platform. What bounds it
//! to a frame is [`wire_frame_changes`]: the step is only a frame while it is the decoration
//! change's own, and half the desktops answer that change with no reading at all.
