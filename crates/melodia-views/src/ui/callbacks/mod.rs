//! Pull-side glue: every `Player.on_*` callback declared in the Slint UI is wired here to
//! a `library::*` function, on the event-loop thread, dispatching the work onto tokio.
//!
//! What is left here is the cross-cutting set, answering to no single view. `wire_all`
//! wires the `Player` global itself plus the `Nav` persist callback; each view slice owns
//! its wiring under `ui/<view>/callbacks/`.

// `pub(in crate::ui)` rather than private: each view slice owns its own `callbacks/`
// submodule, so the wiring reaching these isn't a descendant of this module. Still sealed
// inside `ui::` — nothing in `library/`, `player/` or `boot/` can name either.
