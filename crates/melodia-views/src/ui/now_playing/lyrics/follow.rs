//! Following the song down the sheet: which line is being sung, and where it sits.
//!
//! **The panel owns no state of its own beyond its scroll position.** The sung index and the
//! offset it sits at are written from here, because following the song needs a cumulative offset
//! table and Slint cannot hand one back: a `for` loop exposes no per-item element whose `y` could
//! be read. So this decides how tall each row is drawn and the panel obeys, which is what makes
//! the table and the layout agree by construction rather than by luck.
//!
//! **The panel does not virtualize, and a `ListView` is what it cannot use rather than what it has
//! not got around to.** Slint's listview repeater does measure real per-row heights, so uneven
//! rows are not the objection they read as — but it *owns* the scroller's geometry: it writes
//! `viewport-y` itself on every layout pass, and publishes `viewport-height` as an average row
//! height times the row count, re-derived from whichever rows happen to be mounted. This panel's
//! whole design is the opposite of that: it centres the sung line by writing `viewport-y` from an
//! exact offset table, and the overlay scrollbar gauges extent off `viewport-height`. Under a
//! `ListView` the first would be overwritten every frame and the second would drift as the sheet
//! scrolled through rows a gloss makes nearly twice as tall. What makes the plain `for` right
//! instead is that a sheet is small and, via [`super::rows::MAX_ROWS`], bounded.
