//! The library scan: one folder's walk, read and write, and the reconcile that runs it over several
//! in turn.
//!
//! Every scan stops on a token from [`ScanControl`](crate::state::ScanControl), so [`cancel`]
//! stops any of them, and quitting stops them at the same checkpoints: the walk, the incremental
//! filter, each file of a read, and the head of every chunk. **A stopped scan keeps what it read
//! and deletes nothing**, the one exception being the import of a folder just added, which a
//! cancel takes back out ([`OnStop::Withdraw`]). Otherwise committed chunks stay, and so does the
//! part of the chunk read when the cancel landed. The orphan purge doesn't run, its walk being
//! incomplete, and the folder isn't stamped as scanned. The next scan of the folder reads only the
//! rest, the size and mtime gate skipping everything already stored.
//!
//! A scan leaves alone the files of a library folder nested inside its own, which stay that
//! folder's until a completed scan absorbs it.
