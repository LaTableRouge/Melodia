//! Tests for the watcher's reconcile pass: which branch a file event takes, and what each one
//! is allowed to write.
//!
//! Two threads run through them. The first is *where the stored mtime comes from*:
//! `update_track_location` writes `date_modified` but not `file_size` / `file_hash`, so a mtime
//! re-read at write time would land in the row beside the previous scan's size, and an in-place
//! tag edit that happened not to change the size would then read as current to
//! `scanner::track_is_current` forever. The mtime must come from the `ExtractedMetadata` the
//! batch already produced for that path.
//!
//! The second is *what a move costs*. Rating, play count and favourite are not derived from the
//! file, so a reconcile that reads a relocation as an import loses them and no rescan brings
//! them back. The handler tests drive that decision directly; the `process_batch` tests at the
//! bottom drive it against real bytes, because a delete and a create only meet at that level.
