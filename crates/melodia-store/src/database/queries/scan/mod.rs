//! Scan-time database operations: foreign-key upserts, track row
//! mutations, lookups, and the natural-sort-key helper.
//!
//! The five submodules are organised by *intent*: [`upserts`] handles
//! find-or-create on artist / album / genre rows, [`name_cache`] keeps
//! those answers for the span of a transaction, [`mutations`] holds
//! every track-row write, [`lookups`] holds read-side queries used by
//! the scanner / file-event processor, and [`sort_key`] precomputes the
//! `tracks.sort_key` column. Every public function is re-exported here
//! so callers continue to address them through `queries::scan::*`.
